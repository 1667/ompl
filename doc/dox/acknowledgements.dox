      This project is supported in part NSF CCLI grant #0920721 and a generous donation by <a href="http://www.willowgarage.com">Willow Garage</a>. The code is based on an older version of OMPL written by Ioan È˜ucan while at Willow Garage. This project has also benefited from previous efforts by the Kavraki lab to develop a motion planning software package. The Object-Oriented System for Motion Planning (OOPSMP) in particular provided significant inspiration in the design of OMPL. We are indebted to all other Kavraki lab members, past and present, for providing code, inspiration, and feedback.
