	   @par Short description
	   

	   KPIECE is a tree-based planner that uses a discretization
	   (multiple levels, in general) to guide the exploration of
	   the continous space. This implementation is a simplified
	   one, using a single level of discretization: one grid. The
	   grid is imposed on a projection of the state space. When
	   exploring the space, preference is given to the boundary of
	   this grid. The boundary is computed to be the set of grid
	   cells that have less than 2n non-diagonal neighbors in an
	   n-dimensional projection space.
	   
	   This variant of the implementation use two trees of
	   exploration with lazy collision checking, hence the LB
	   prefix.
